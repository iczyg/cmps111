Checksum.c –

	Main: reads in a file and copies its contents to a new file named “copyfile”. It then copies the file to a character array and saves the number of bytes read from the file. The function checksum is then called and the results are printed. 
	
	checkSum:  adds up the integer value of all of the characters in the file and returns the result.
