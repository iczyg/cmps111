increments.c

increments.c is a test script that runs x number of forks that do an incremention process from an initial value y to (y + 100) with an incrementation of 0.000001.
The initial value is an irrelavent value that is equal to it's fork ID number multiplied by 2.
The x variable is determined by the parameters given when the program is run. 
The program either accepts either none or one double parameter. 
If the program is given a parameter, x is equal to that parameter. 
If there are no parameters given, then x is equal to one. 
Each fork records how long it took to compelete its incrementation operation. 
Once each fork is created, then the time for when the fork was created is recorded. 
After the process of the fork is finished, then the fork will print its ID and finished run time. 
The run time is calculated by finding the difference between its end time and the time that the fork was created.
